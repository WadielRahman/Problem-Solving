Here, I shall add the Questions to the problems I have solved in Main.

🧩 Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Code Recipe

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Return the answer in any order.

💡 Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Output: [0, 1]

Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 2 + 7 == 9

💡 Example 2:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6

Output: [1, 2]

💡 Example 3:
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6

Output: [0, 1]

✅ Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴

-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹

-10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹

Only one valid answer exists.
